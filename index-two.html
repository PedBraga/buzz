                <p>Audrey is a 12-year-old girl from Arizona with a passion for fashion. She spends her free time
                    flipping through style magazines and listening to her favorite songs. While Audrey’s interests are
                    not uncommon for girls her age, her life is very different due to a nervous system disorder she
                    struggles with daily. Unbeknownst to her parents, Audrey had a stroke at birth and was diagnosed at
                    6 months old with a vascular disorder that causes an abnormal tangle of blood vessels connecting
                    arteries and veins, which disrupts normal blood flow and oxygen circulation. At 14 months old, she
                    had a lifesaving surgery, but continues to have daily seizures, which began when she was 3 years
                    old.
                </p>
            
               
                <p> For the past five years, she has been educated by tutors from noon to 5 p.m. When she’s not at
                    school, Audrey has doctor or therapy appointments to adjust her leg braces or medication. Sometimes,
                    she has multiple doctor’s appointments on the same day.
                </p>

                <p>“My daughter is probably one of the
                    strongest people I know. She never complains about anything. Even if she’s having a bad seizure day,
                    she’s like, ‘I got this,’ and it makes you appreciate the life that you have,” said Lisa, Audrey’s
                    mom.</p>

                After a successful program with three local Make-A-Wish chapters (Arizona, Nebraska, and Central &
                Northern Florida)—raising almost $90,000—the free Prescription Discount Card program benefiting
                Make-A-Wish was extended to all 59 chapters across the United States as of November 1, 2014. We started
                this program so Make-A-Wish could have an additional source of funding for the important work they do
                creating life-changing wishes for children with critical illnesses. Donations stay in the communities in
                which they are raised to help grant wishes locally.
